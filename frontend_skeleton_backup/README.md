# Governance Kernel Frontend (Angular skeleton)

This folder contains a minimal Angular 17 skeleton for the Governance Kernel UI.

To run (if you have Angular CLI installed):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

Files provided are lightweight stubs for components and services. They use `fetch` under the hood so they can be adapted easily into a full Angular project.
